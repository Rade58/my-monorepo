# Events

For event handler we use `on` directive

```html
<script>
	let m = { x: 0, y: 0 };
  let k = {x: 0, y: 0}

	function handleMove(event) {
		m.x = event.clientX;
		m.y = event.clientY;
	}
</script>

<!-- syntax includes colon (:), which we don't see in
javascript or other frameworks 
 but it is intuitive -->
<div on:pointermove={handleMove}>
	The pointer is at {m.x} x {m.y}
</div>

<!-- here we inlined event handler
 because in some reason we don't need named fuction
 if we are using event handler fuction only on one place-->
<div on:pointermove={e => {
	k.x = e.clientX;
	k.y = e.clientY
}}>
	The pointer is at {k.x} x {k.y}
</div>

<style>
	div {
    border: crimson solid 2px;
		width: 100%;
		height: 50%;
		padding: 1rem;
	}
</style>
```

**IN SOME FRAMEWORKS PEOPLE AVOID USING INLINE HNDLERS BECAUSE THEY EXPECT THAT FUCTION IS GOING TO BE RECREATED ON EVERY RENDER, `BUT IN CASE OF SVELTE IT IS COMPLETELY FINE TO USE INLINE HANDLERS`**
