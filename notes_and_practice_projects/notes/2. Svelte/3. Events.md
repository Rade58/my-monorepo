# Events

For event handler we use `on` directive

```html
<script>
	let m = { x: 0, y: 0 };
  let k = {x: 0, y: 0}

	function handleMove(event) {
		m.x = event.clientX;
		m.y = event.clientY;
	}
</script>

<!-- syntax includes colon (:), which we don't see in
javascript or other frameworks 
 but it is intuitive -->
<div on:pointermove={handleMove}>
	The pointer is at {m.x} x {m.y}
</div>

<!-- here we inlined event handler
 because in some reason we don't need named fuction
 if we are using event handler fuction only on one place-->
<div on:pointermove={e => {
	k.x = e.clientX;
	k.y = e.clientY
}}>
	The pointer is at {k.x} x {k.y}
</div>

<style>
	div {
    border: crimson solid 2px;
		width: 100%;
		height: 50%;
		padding: 1rem;
	}
</style>
```

**IN SOME FRAMEWORKS PEOPLE AVOID USING INLINE HNDLERS BECAUSE THEY EXPECT THAT FUCTION IS GOING TO BE RECREATED ON EVERY RENDER, `BUT IN CASE OF SVELTE IT IS COMPLETELY FINE TO USE INLINE HANDLERS`**

# Modifiers `|`

IT IS SELF EVIDENT FOR WHAT THEY ARE USED

For example if we want handler to execute only once we will use `|once` MODIFIER (handler wil be removed after first execution)

```html
<script>
	let a = 0;
</script>

<!-- it will execute only on first click -->
<button on:click|once={() => a++}>
	Click me
</button>

<div>{a}</div>
```

## Full list of modifiers

- `preventDefault` — calls event.preventDefault() before running the handler. Useful for client-side form handling, for example.
- `stopPropagation` — calls event.stopPropagation(), preventing the event reaching the next element
- `passive` — improves scrolling performance on touch/wheel events (Svelte will add it automatically where it's safe to do so)
- `nonpassive` — explicitly set passive: false
- `capture` — fires the handler during the capture phase instead of the bubbling phase
- `once` — remove the handler after the first time it runs
- `self` — only trigger handler if event.target is the element itself
- `trusted` — only trigger handler if event.isTrusted is true, meaning the event was triggered by a user action rather than because some JavaScript called element.dispatchEvent(...)
