# classes and Styles

# `class:` DIRECTIVE

again we have "strange" svelte syntax, this time we can write ternarys inside strings in order to conditionally set classes

```jsx

// <!-- `foo` is some variable and `flipped` is a name of some class -->

<button
	class="card {foo ? 'flipped' : ''}"
	on:click={() => foo = !foo}
>
```

but there is a shorthand for this

```jsx
<button
	class="card"
  // see this
  class:flipped={foo}
	on:click={() => foo = !foo}
>
```

**BUT LETS SAY VARIABLE AND THE CLASS BY CHANCE HAVE SAME NAME, WHICH SHOULD BE ALSO A CONVENTION IF WE WORK WITH BOOLENS**

IN THAT CASE **WE HAVE ANOTHER SHORTHAND**

WE WRITE JUST LIKE THIS

```jsx
<button
	class="card"
  // see this
  class:flipped
  // 
	on:click={() => flipped = !flipped}
>
```
