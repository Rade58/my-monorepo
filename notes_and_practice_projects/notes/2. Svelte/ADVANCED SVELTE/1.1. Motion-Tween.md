# Motion - Tween

These are also stores but I guess they are using animation library under the hood to animate with javascript (I could be wrong)

so instead of getting values that change sharply, by big margin, you will get bunch of values in between through special store 

```html
<script>
	import { tweened } from 'svelte/motion';
	import {cubicOut} from 'svelte/easing'

	const progress = tweened(0, {
		duration: 500,
		easing: cubicOut
	});
</script>

<progress value={$progress} />

<!-- AS YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN USE set() -->
<!-- YOU CAN ALSO USE update -->
<button on:click={() => progress.set(0)}>
	0%
</button>

<button on:click={() => progress.set(0.25)}>
	25%
</button>

<button on:click={() => progress.set(0.5)}>
	50%
</button>

<button on:click={() => progress.set(0.75)}>
	75%
</button>

<button on:click={() => progress.set(1)}>
	100%
</button>

<style>
	progress {
		display: block;
		width: 100%;
	}
</style>

```

## Option we can pass

- `delay` — milliseconds before the tween starts

- `duration` — either the duration of the tween in milliseconds, or a `(from, to) => milliseconds` function allowing you to (e.g.) specify longer tweens for larger changes in value

- `easing` — a `p => t` function

- `interpolate` — a custom `(from, to) => t => value` function for interpolating between arbitrary values. By default, Svelte will interpolate between numbers, dates, and identically-shaped arrays and objects (as long as they only contain numbers and dates or other valid arrays and objects). If you want to interpolate (for example) colour strings or transformation matrices, supply a custom interpolator
