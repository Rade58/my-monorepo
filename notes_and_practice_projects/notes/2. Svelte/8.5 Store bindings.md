# Store bindings

Just like you can bind vriables to inputs (and other form elements) you can bind store

Of course, we are talking about Writible stores (or derived)

See it from example

Here is the store

```js
import { writable, derived } from 'svelte/store';

export const name = writable('world');

export const greeting = derived(name, ($name) => `Hello ${$name}!`);
```

Lets bind it

***

ps.

**I will also show you how to write shorthand when you want to update with `set` METHOD**

***

`App.svelte`

```html
<script>
	import { name, greeting } from './stores.js';
</script>

<h1>{$greeting}</h1>
<!-- AS YOU CAN SEE I DID BINDING IN HERE  -->
<!-- AND AGAIN , I AM MENTIONING TO YOU THAT WE ARE USING
   $  TO AVOID WRITING UNSUBSCRIPTION CODE IN onDestroy  -->
<input bind:value={$name} />

<!-- SEE HERE HOW WE USE set -->
<button on:click={() => {
	// this is obvious way
	
	//     name.set($name + "!")
	//but instead you can write
	$name += "!";
	
}} >
	Add exclamation mark!
</button>
```
