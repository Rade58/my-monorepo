# Custom writable store

Let's say you don't want to expose `set` or `update` methods of the store. Let's say you only want to build methods that will update the store the way you want

**For  this to accomplish you can return just object that contains `subscribe` method ith rest of your custom methods**

See example

`stores.js`

```js
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';


// I don't know why we need to build function in here
// I would just export object

// but I guess this is another convention that we build function
// we call that function and export object it produces

function createCount() {
	const { subscribe, set, update } = writable(0);

	return {
    // we return subscribe
		subscribe,

    // and custom methods we built
		increment: () => {
			update((prev) => prev + 1)
		},
		decrement: () => {
			update((prev) => prev - 1)
			
		},
		reset: () => {
			set(0)
		}
	};
}

// see here function is called

export const count = createCount();
```

Let's try it

`App.svelte`

```html
<script>
	import { count } from './stores.js';
</script>

<!-- just to remind you about $   . We are doing this to avoid
bilerplate of unsubscribing onDestroy
it's a shorthand I explained to you inside 8.1 lection (at the end) -->
<h1>The count is {$count}</h1>

<button on:click={count.increment}>+</button>
<button on:click={count.decrement}>-</button>
<button on:click={count.reset}>reset</button>
```
