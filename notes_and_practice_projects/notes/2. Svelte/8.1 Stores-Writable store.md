# Store

Sharing and updating state across components of your app

**An object with a `subscribe` method that allows interested parties (a components that rely on that state) to be notified whenever stores value get changed**

## Writable stores

Let's do an example

Lets create the store which state value will be number

We are creating it in a new file from which we can export the store, **We can create a store in script tag but why would we do that, since in that case we could only use store in one component**

`stores.js`

```js
import {writable} from 'svelte/store'
// added six as a defult value
export const count = writable(6)
```

Let's create components where we will apply methods on the store, in order to change its value

with `.update` we have access to previous value (through callback)

with `.set` we don't, we just pass new value


`Decrementer.svelte`

```html
<script>
	import { count } from './stores.js';

	function decrement() {
		// TODO decrement the count
		count.update(prev => prev - 1)
	}
</script>

<button on:click={decrement}>
	-
</button>
```

`Incrementer.svelte`

```html
<script>
	import { count } from './stores.js';

	function increment() {
		// TODO increment the count
		count.update(prev => prev + 1)
	}
</script>

<button on:click={increment}>
	+
</button>
```

`Resetter.svelte`

```html
<script>
	import { count } from './stores.js';

	function reset() {
		// TODO reset the count
		count.set(6)
	}
</script>

<button on:click={reset}>
	reset
</button>
```

**LIKE I SAID IN ANY COMPONENT THAT NEEDS THE VALUE WE USE `subscribe` METHOD**

In our case this is root (App.svelte) that needs the value

`App.svelte`

```html
<script>
	import { count } from './stores.js';
	import Incrementer from './Incrementer.svelte';
	import Decrementer from './Decrementer.svelte';
	import Resetter from './Resetter.svelte';

	let count_value;

	count.subscribe((value) => {
		count_value = value;
	});
</script>

<h1>The count is {count_value}</h1>

<Incrementer />
<Decrementer />
<Resetter />
```

# To sumarize about methods of writable store

`subscribe` method has a callback with current value of the store (returned value of this method is `unsubscribe` function)

`update` allows us to use old value when we want to set new value

`set` doesn't allow us to use old value when we want to set

# Auto subscription

In last example I showed you how can you use `subscribe` method to access state value from the store

Well since we never unsubscribed when component mounts and unmounts couuple of time `the memory leak can be produced` everz time component gets created and destrozed and we don't want this to happen

This is part of the code where we used subscription but also defined unsubscripton (I didn't show all the code because I want to show it in cleanest way possible)

This is in script tag ofcourse

```js
import {onDestroy} from 'svelte'
import {count} from './stores.js'

let cout_value;

const unsubscribe = count.subscribe((value) => {
	count_value = value;
});

onDestroy(unsubscribe)
// ...
// ...
// And as you know outside script tag (in html or whatever is called in 
// svelte) we can reference     count_value

```

**BUT ALL OF THIS CODE ABOVE CAN BE REPLACED BY JUST USING STORE VALUE TOGETHER WITH DOLLAR DIRECTLLY IN SCRIPT TAG OR HTML, KLIKE THIS `$<store>`**

```html
<!-- so all of this code above is replaced by this -->
<h1>The count is {$count}</h1>

<!-- WE DON'T NEED TO USE THIS -->
<!-- <h1>The count is {count_value}</h1> -->
```

Just remind you that you can use `$<store>` both in html code and inside script
