# Intro

Starting point of learning Svelte

<https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte>


## Some important things about styles

```html
<script>
	import Nested from './Nested.svelte'	
</script>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!-- let's say this component is also paragraph -->
<Nested />

<style>
  /* well, this styles wont apply on Nested component 
  they are scoped only for this current file*/
	p {
		color: goldenrod;
		font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;
		font-size: 2em;
	}
</style>
```

## Inserting strings that contain html format

```html
<script>
	let something = `this string contains some <strong>HTML!!!</strong>`;
</script>

<p>{@html  something}</p>
```

Yo ushouldn't use this in case of non sanitized user generated content (user comments, dataa from datbase...) because of XSS attacks

## Reactivity: assignment, Declarations

```html
<script>
	let count = 0;

	function increment() {
		// event handler code goes here
	count +=1;
		
	}

  // I guess we need to use $: to derive state from something
  // this is 'declaration'
  // something that depends on reactive variable
	$: double = count * 2;
	
	
</script>

<button on:click={increment}>
	Clicked {count}
	{count === 1 ? 'time' : 'times'}
</button>
<div>
	Double: {double}
</div>

```

## Statements we can define with $: also

```html
<script>
	let count = 0;

	function handleClick() {
		count += 1;
	}

  // as you can see, you can use brackets
	$: {
		console.log(`Count ${count}`)
		handleClick();
		// alert(4);

	}

  $: if(count > 6) console.log("It's over six");

	
</script>

<button on:click={handleClick}>
	Clicked {count}
	{count === 1 ? 'time' : 'times'}
</button>
```

## Updating arrays and objcts

**ASSIGNMENT WILL ONLY TRIGGER THE RERENDER**

So if we are doing array methods like push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, and on the other hand we are, for example using reduce to make calculation with array items, the result will not change on the screen because we are using same array and adding an item to it will not trigger calculation in some statement for example

```html
<script>
	let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

	function addNumber() {
		// numbers.push(numbers.length + 1);
		// I added this and rerender will be triggered when we click
		// numbers = numbers
		// INSTEAD OF TWO UPPER LINES U COULD OF DO THIS
		numbers = [...numbers, numbers.length + 1]
	}
	// this didn't get triggered before since array stayed the same 
	// but since we are using new array when we adding new number to it
	// the statement will get executed
	$: sum = numbers.reduce((total, currentNumber) => total + currentNumber, 0);
</script>

<p>{numbers.join(' + ')} = {sum}</p>

<button on:click={addNumber}>
	Add a number
</button>
```

**ASSIGNMENT TO PROPERTIS OF OBJECT OR ASSIGNMENT OF ITEMS TO ARRAY WILL ALSO TRIGGER THE RERENDER**

```html
<script>
	let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

	function addNumber() {
		// we can do this
		numbers[numbers.length] = numbers.length + 1
		// if we had an object
		// foo["bar"] = "baz"      // this would also trigger rerender
	}

	$: sum = numbers.reduce((total, currentNumber) => total + currentNumber, 0);
</script>

<p>{numbers.join(' + ')} = {sum}</p>

<button on:click={addNumber}>
	Add a number
</button>
```

## Props

**Exporting an declared variable will make that variable a prop**

```html
<!-- this is file called:    Nested.svelte    -->

<script>
	// this is going to be a prop of this component
	// if we would assign value to it that value would be defult
	// if we didn't pass parop when using this component
	export let answer;
	export let something = 56
</script>

<p>The answer is {answer}</p>
<p>Something is {something}</p>
```

```html
<script>
	import Nested from './Nested.svelte';
</script>

<Nested answer={42} />
```

This will get endered

```
The answer is 42

Something is 56
```

## Spreading props

```html
<script>
	import PackageInfo from './PackageInfo.svelte';

	const pkg = {
		name: 'svelte',
		speed: 'blazing',
		version: 4,
		website: 'https://svelte.dev'
	};
</script>

<PackageInfo
	name={pkg.name}
	speed={pkg.speed}
	website={pkg.website}
/>

<!-- as you can se I spreaded props here -->
<PackageInfo {...pkg} />
```

## You can access all props with special `$$props`, but usage of this is not recommended

You can access all props with it, the ones you declared and ones you didn't

```html
<script>
	export let foo = 4
</script>

<!-- I bar prop is passed render it -->
<p>
	Foo is {foo} and bar
	{#if $$props.bar}
	is {$$props.bar}
	{/if}
</p>

```
