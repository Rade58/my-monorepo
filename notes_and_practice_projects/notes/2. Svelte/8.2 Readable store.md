# Readable store

Some store needs not to be writtable by someone who has reference to them.

These stores are good for state that represents time, or mouse position, or geolocation

It doesn't make sense for this values to be setable from outside

**So I guess, this mean state will be setted when you create the store** (that initial value will be the 'shared value' (but this is changable value because it relies on time or mouse position or geolocation))

example:

`stores.js`

```js
import { readable } from 'svelte/store';

export const time = readable(null, function start(set) {
	// setup code goes here
	const interval = setInterval(() => {
		set(new Date())
	}, 1000)

	
	return function stop() {
		// teardown code goes here
		clearInterval(interval)
	};
});
```

`App.svelte`

```html
<script>
	import { time } from './stores.js';

	const formatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(
		'en',
		{
			hour12: true,
			hour: 'numeric',
			minute: '2-digit',
			second: '2-digit'
		}
	);
</script>

<!-- as you can see we are usin shorthnd $<store> in here
  which is important and which I explained to you in last lection -->

<h1>The time is {formatter.format($time)}</h1>
```
