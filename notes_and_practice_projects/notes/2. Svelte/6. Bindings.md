# Bindings

## Text Inputs

We can use event handler in this situation but Svelte has `bind:` directive (**Whith event handlers we would need to write `BOILERPLATE CODE` and bindings are helping us not to write boilrtplate event handler code**)

```html
<script>
	let name = 'world';
</script>

<!-- IT WOULDN'T WOURK WITHOUT
bind:  DIRECTIVE -->
<!-- if we didn't have bind: we would add event handlers in
which we would assign to some variable -->
<input bind:value={name} />

<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
```

## Numeric inputs

**Doesn't matter input value are strings, Svelte will convert them to numbers for you**

```html
<script>
	// like you see these are numbers
	let a = 1;
	let b = 2;
</script>

<label>
	<!-- Svelte while binding will convert strings to numbers -->
	<input type="number" bind:value={a} min="0" max="10" />
	<input type="range" bind:value={a} min="0" max="10" />
</label>

<label>
	<input type="number" bind:value={b} min="0" max="10" />
	<input type="range" bind:value={b} min="0" max="10" />
</label>

<!-- and you can do number operaations -->
<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>
```

## Checkbox inputs

IN THIS CASE WE ARE BINDING `checked` ATTRIBUTE, INSTEAD OF value

```html
<script>
	let yes = false;
</script>

<label>
	<input type="checkbox" bind:checked={yes} />
	Yes! Send me regular email spam
</label>

{#if yes}
	<p>
		Thank you. We will bombard your inbox and sell
		your personal details.
	</p>
{:else}
	<p>
		You must opt in to continue. If you're not
		paying, you're the product.
	</p>
{/if}

<button disabled={!yes}>Subscribe</button>
```

## Select

```html
<script>

	// we have list of items
	// and these items will be values of corresponding `<option>`
	// after we use 		#each     to render them 
	let questions = [
		{
			id: 1,
			text: `Where did you go to school?`
		},
		{
			id: 2,
			text: `What is your mother's name?`
		},
		{
			id: 3,
			text: `What is another personal fact that an attacker could easily find with Google?`
		}
	];

	// value of this is going to be specific item from the list
	let selectedItem;

	let answer = '';

	function handleSubmit() {
		alert(
			`answered question ${selectedItem.id} (${selectedItem.text}) with "${answer}"`
		);
	}
</script>

<h2>Insecurity questions</h2>

<form on:submit|preventDefault={handleSubmit}>
	<select
		// ---- WE BINDIND THIS `value` ------
		// ---- A value OF SELECTED OPTION ----
		bind:value={selectedItem}
		on:change={() => (answer = '')}
	>
		{#each questions as question}
			<option value={question}>
				{question.text}
			</option>
		{/each}
	</select>

	<input bind:value={answer} />

	<button disabled={!answer} type="submit">
		Submit
	</button>
</form>

<p>
	selected question {selectedItem
		? selectedItem.id
		: '[waiting...]'}
</p>
```
