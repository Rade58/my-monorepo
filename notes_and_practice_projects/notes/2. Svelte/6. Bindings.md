# Bindings

## Text Inputs

We can use event handler in this situation but Svelte has `bind:` directive (**Whith event handlers we would need to write `BOILERPLATE CODE` and bindings are helping us not to write boilrtplate event handler code**)

```html
<script>
	let name = 'world';
</script>

<!-- IT WOULDN'T WOURK WITHOUT
bind:  DIRECTIVE -->
<!-- if we didn't have bind: we would add event handlers in
which we would assign to some variable -->
<input bind:value={name} />

<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
```

## Numeric inputs

**Doesn't matter input value are strings, Svelte will convert them to numbers for you**

```html
<script>
	// like you see these are numbers
	let a = 1;
	let b = 2;
</script>

<label>
	<!-- Svelte while binding will convert strings to numbers -->
	<input type="number" bind:value={a} min="0" max="10" />
	<input type="range" bind:value={a} min="0" max="10" />
</label>

<label>
	<input type="number" bind:value={b} min="0" max="10" />
	<input type="range" bind:value={b} min="0" max="10" />
</label>

<!-- and you can do number operaations -->
<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>
```

## Checkbox inputs

IN THIS CASE WE ARE BINDING `checked` ATTRIBUTE, INSTEAD OF value

```html
<script>
	let yes = false;
</script>

<label>
	<input type="checkbox" bind:checked={yes} />
	Yes! Send me regular email spam
</label>
