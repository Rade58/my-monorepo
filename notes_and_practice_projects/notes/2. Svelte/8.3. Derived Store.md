# Derived store

Let's say you have some readable store which value is interval based (depends on data and time), and you want to derive something from that value and make it to be some other state

`stores.js`

```js
import { readable, derived } from 'svelte/store';

// first store ("major one"), a readable store which value is 
// date every second
export const time = readable(new Date(), function start(set) {
	const interval = setInterval(() => {
		set(new Date());
	}, 1000);

	return function stop() {
		clearInterval(interval);
	};
});

// you can say thaat this date is the one from which
// we start calculating
const start = new Date();

// A DERIVED STORE
export const elapsed = derived(
	time,  // DERIVED FROM OUR REDABLE STORE
	// THE DERIVED STATE WILL BE A NUMBER OF SECONDS
	// FROM START
	($time) => { return Math.round(($time - start) /1000)}
	// $    isn't special synatax
	// people just use it to mark it from what value they are 
  // deriving new state
);
```

And here we  are using both original readable store and derived store

```html
<script>
	import { time, elapsed } from './stores.js';

	const formatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(
		'en',
		{
			hour12: true,
			hour: 'numeric',
			minute: '2-digit',
			second: '2-digit'
		}
	);
</script>

<h1>The time is {formatter.format($time)}</h1>

<p>
	This page has been open for
	{$elapsed}
	{$elapsed === 1 ? 'second' : 'seconds'}
</p>

```


## You can't derive multiple stores from writable stores

it only works with readable
