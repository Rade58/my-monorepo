# Components events

The best way for me to understand and explain this is to consider this events to be "fake" event (we can "make up a type") that can be dispatched from any component and be catched outside of that component, **since event handler is passed (assigned) to that compomponent when we render the component**

For example event dispatched from child component can be listened to inside parent component

`Inner.svelte` component

```html
<script>

	import {createEventDispatcher} from 'svelte'

	const dispatch = createEventDispatcher()
	
	function sayHello() {
		// ass you can see here in this fuction we dispatch another event
		// and also event can have payload (`text` in this example)
		dispatch('foobar', {
			text: 'Shiba Inu!'
		});
	}

</script>

<button on:click={sayHello}>
	Click to say hello
</button>
```

WE WILL RENDER THIS COMPONENT IN HERE

`App.svelte`

```html
<script>
	import Inner from './Inner.svelte';

  // this is going to be the handler for that "fake event"
	function handleFooBar(event) {
		alert(event.detail.text);
	}
</script>

<!-- we added event listener like this -->
<Inner on:foobar={handleFooBar} />

```
