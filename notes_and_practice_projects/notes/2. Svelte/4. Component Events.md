# Components events

The best way for me to understand and explain this is to consider this events to be "fake" event (we can "make up a type") that can be dispatched from any component and be catched outside of that component, **since event handler is passed (assigned) to that compomponent when we render the component**

For example event dispatched from child component can be listened to inside parent component

`Inner.svelte` component

```html
<script>

	import {createEventDispatcher} from 'svelte'

	const dispatch = createEventDispatcher()
	
	function sayHello() {
		// ass you can see here in this fuction we dispatch another event
		// and also event can have payload (`text` in this example)
		dispatch('foobar', {
			text: 'Shiba Inu!'
		});
	}

</script>

<button on:click={sayHello}>
	Click to say hello
</button>
```

WE WILL RENDER THIS COMPONENT IN HERE

`App.svelte`

```html
<script>
	import Inner from './Inner.svelte';

  // this is going to be the handler for that "fake event"
	function handleFooBar(event) {
		alert(event.detail.text);
	}
</script>

<!-- we added event listener like this -->
<Inner on:foobar={handleFooBar} />

```

# Event forwarding

As you see in last example we forwarded event from child to parent

**but what if you have deeply nested child which dispatches the event and we need to listen for that event inside, lets say, the top hierarchical ancestor**

This is deeply nested child

`Inner.svelte`

```html
<script>
	import {createEventDispatcher } from 'svelte'

	const dispatch = createEventDispatcher()
	

	function sayFooBar() {

		dispatch('foobar', {
			text: 'Crypto foo'
		})
			
	}
</script>

<button on:click={sayFooBar}>
	Click to say hello
</button>
```

*THIS IS GOING TO BE ANCESTOR WE TALKED ABOUT, IN WHICH `Inner.svelte` WILL BE **indirectly nested***

`App.svelte`

```html
<script>
	// this is the parent event of the Inner.svelte
  // A "mediary" component between App.svelte (ancestor) and
  // Inner.svelte (descendant)
	import Outer from './Outer.svelte';

	// this is the event handler we want to execute on:foobar
	function handleFooBar(event) {
		alert(event.detail.text);
	}
</script>

<Outer on:foobar={handleFooBar} />
```

**SO, HOW DO WE ACOMPLISH PASSING THE EVENT IN "mediary" COMPONENTS LIKE THIS ONE**

`Outer.svelte`

```html
<script>
	import Inner from './Inner.svelte';
</script>

<!-- WE JUST NEED TO PUT on:<event> -->
<Inner on:foobar />

<!-- I guess no matter how deep nested is component that dispatches event  -->
<!-- we can use on:<event> in mediary components -->
  <!-- so we can forward the event -->

```
