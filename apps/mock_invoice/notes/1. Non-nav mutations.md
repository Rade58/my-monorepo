# Non nav mutations

submitting form makes page reload, end leavs entry in history, if instead we want page refresh not to happen we would use `fetcher.Form` instead of `Form` component

<https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-fetcher#fetcherform>

I used this in here: `/routes/__app.sales.invoices.$invoiceId.tsx`

USE CASE:

**Well we don't want page refresh if user just favorites a tweet or something similar**
