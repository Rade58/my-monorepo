# Non-nav mutations

submitting form makes page reload (NAVIGATION), end leaves an entry in history. If instead we want page refresh not to happen we would use `fetcher.Form` instead of `Form` component or `form`

<https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-fetcher#fetcherform>

I used this in here: `/routes/__app.sales.invoices.$invoiceId.tsx`

USE CASE:

**Well we don't want page refresh if user just favorites a tweet or something similar**

# So in here it is important that we want to use this if we don't want to have entry in history stack
